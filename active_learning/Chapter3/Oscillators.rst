Oscillators
==========================

Introduction
-----------------------
This activity aims to familiarize readers with the world of oscillators. We will explore different types of oscillators and their functions within electronic circuits.

Background
---------------------
Oscillators play a crucial role in modern electronics and are responsible for generating periodic waveforms. They are used in a variety of applications, from communication systems and audio equipment to digital circuits and control systems. Oscillators can generate various waveform shapes, such as sine waves, square waves, and triangle waves, depending on their design and implementation.

What is an oscillator?
========================
An oscillator is an electronic circuit that generates a periodic waveform, typically without any external input. The generated waveform can be of various shapes, such as sine, square, or triangle waves, and can have different frequencies and amplitudes.

Oscillators operate by employing positive feedback within the circuit, which helps maintain oscillation. The feedback signal can be derived from either voltage or current, depending on the oscillator's design. Oscillators can be classified into two main categories: harmonic oscillators and relaxation oscillators.

Harmonic Oscillators
======================
Harmonic oscillators generate sinusoidal waveforms and are commonly used in applications such as frequency synthesis, signal generation, and clock generation. Some examples of harmonic oscillators include:

1. LC Oscillators: These oscillators use a combination of inductors (L) and capacitors (C) to create an oscillating circuit. Common types of LC oscillators are the Colpitts and Hartley oscillators.

2. Crystal Oscillators: These oscillators use a piezoelectric crystal, such as quartz, as a resonant element to generate a stable frequency. They are widely used in timing devices, such as clocks and watches, due to their high stability and precision.

Relaxation Oscillators
========================
Relaxation oscillators generate non-sinusoidal waveforms, such as square or triangular waves, and are used in applications such as timers, pulse generators, and voltage-controlled oscillators. Examples of relaxation oscillators include:
